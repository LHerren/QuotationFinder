      <p>QuotationFinder stores the results of your search for you to access 
      them in the future. You will need your username and password for that.
      You do not have to say who you really are&#151;just enter any username and
      password you like.</p>

      <h6>Should I use the &quot;whole words&quot; or the &quot;parts of words&quot; option?</h6>
      <p>The &quot;parts of words&quot; option is an easy way for you to find quotations 
      and allusions containing different forms of the words in your search text. 
      Whichever option you choose, you can still have QuotationFinder match 
      additional forms or alternative stems by using the Modify link that appears 
      in the top left corner of the window after you click the Use this Search 
      Text button.</p>

      <p>These pages list the information QuotationFinder uses when searching 
       for quotations. &quot;Word&quot; lists the word as it was entered by you. 
       &quot;Position&quot; indicates the word number within your search text. 
       &quot;Frequency&quot; is about how many times the word occurs in the 
       CLCLT or TLG&#151;the default value is 100. &quot;Forms&quot; has all forms of the 
       word QuotationFinder will look for&#151;the default is just the one form you 
       entered when you first started. &quot;Cognates&quot; has all forms of all 
       cognates of the word QuotationFinder will look for&#151;the default is just 
       the one form you entered when you first started. For further explanations

      function?</h6>
      <p>One reason is that you might find out that your text has been 
      transmitted in more than one form. Take for instance biblical quotations:
      Before there was a standard Latin translation, more than one word may 
      have been used to render the original. Using the Add Words function, you 
      can enter alternative words while giving them identical Position numbers 
      (they would occur in the same place in your text.) For further 
      explanations click

      function?</h6>
      <p>You can use the Modify Words function to improve the searches. If you 
      use the &quot;whole words&quot; option, you can enter all forms, regular and 
      irregular, of all the words and cognates you want QuotationFinder to 
      match, giving you complete control. If you use the &quot;parts of words&quot; 
      option, you can enter alternative word stems (e.g. aorist in TLG), 
      enabling QuotationFinder to find more quotations and allusions.<br>
      Also, you can greatly improve QuotationFinder's ranking of the 
      quotations by modifying the Frequency information. For further
      instructions read on.</p>

      <h6><a name="Fill_Fields"></a>How do I fill in the Word, Position, 
      Frequency, Forms, and Cognates fields?</h6>
      <p>Filling out the Word, Forms, and Cognates fields is easy if you're 
      using the &quot;parts of words&quot; option: Just enter the exact form of 
      the Search Text word in the Word field, and the stems of the word and its 
      cognates in the Forms and Cognates fields, respectively.<br>
      If you're using the &quot;whole words&quot; option and you want to find as 
      many quotations or allusions as possible, you will have to enter 
      all forms, regular and irregular, of the word and its cognates. 
      With the CLCLT, you could do this by entering a truncated form of a 
      word in the CLCLT search software, copying all forms the CLCLT word 
      index returns, and pasting them a dozen at a time to the 
      <a href="http://lysy2.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/words.exe" target="_blank">Words</a> 
      program to see if they are forms of your word or a cognate.<br>
      By definition, the content of the Word field must also be in the 
      Forms and Cognates fields; the content of the Forms field must 
      also be in the Cognates field.<br>
      In order to improve the ranking of the quotations, do a CD-ROM search 
      for the word form in your Search Text to get the correct count on 
      how many times it occurs in the CLCLT or TLG body of texts. Then 
      paste the information back in QuotationFinder's Frequency field. A 
      match of a rare word is more likely to indicate a quotation and is 
      moved up in QuotationFinder's ranking accordingly.<br>
      If you're using the Add Words function, you will have to fill in the 
      Position field. Simply number the words in your Search Text up to the 
      position where the added word occurs.</p>

      <p>If you want QuotationFinder's ranking to be accurate, you should 
      use the Modify Words function to edit the Frequency information. However, 
      for words that occur very frequently, this is not worth the trouble. 
      You should delete them using this function. (We needed these words in 
      the beginning to get correct values for the position fields of the 
      other words.)</p>

      <h6><a name="Choose_File"></a>What kinds of files can I choose for 
      QuotationFinder to find quotations in?</h6>
      <p>QuotationFinder works with files exported from the CLCLT and the 
      TLG CD-ROMs (TLG: files exported by Pandora or TLG Workplace 
      only&#151;<a href="mailto:lherren@uni-muenster.de">let me know</a> if you would 
      like to use QuotationFinder with files exported from some other TLG 
      search software.)<br>
      Do a CD-ROM search (using Pandora/TLG Workplace for the TLG or the 
      software that came with the CLCLT) for all but the most common words 
      in your Search Text. Truncate rare words to find all forms so that 
      QuotationFinder can find allusions as well. Save the resulting 
      passages, including their context (Pandora: Change Export Settings 
      to Beta. TLG Workplace: Uncheck all checkboxes in Setup > Preferences 
      > Language Display; use File > Save Results as RTF File). Then you 
      can get QuotationFinder to find quotes by clicking the Choose button 
      on the Choose File page, selecting the file you just saved, and 
      clicking the Start Search button.<br>
      If this is your first time using QuotationFinder, you may want to 
      start by doing a CD-ROM search for one of the words of your search 
      text that don't occur too often. This should result in a smaller 
      file to be exported. It will not take as long for QuotationFinder 
      to process it, and you will know sooner if everything works as 
      expected.</p>

      <p>Yes. If they are in the wrong font, QuotationFinder may not find 
      anything. To make sure you have the correct settings, do the following:<br>
      Pandora: Click Setup, then click the Beta radio button in the Export 
      Settings.<br>
      TLG Workplace: Go to Setup > Preferences > Language Display, then uncheck 
      all checkboxes.

      <p>The default behavior of QuotationFinder is to rank the results 
      according to how precise it considers the quotations to be (see 
      above on how to improve the ranking). However, you may prefer to 
      have all quotations by a particular writer grouped together. If 
      you choose that option, you will get the results listed 
      alphabetically by author and work.</p>

      Search Text. However, if you prefer to delete the previous results, 
      you can choose for QuotationFinder to do so here.</p>

      <h6><a name="Search_Progress"></a>Is there a limit to the file size
      QuotationFinder can handle?</h6>
      <p>Using QuotationFinder with very large files does pose some problems. 
      For one thing, if you access QuotationFinder through a modem, it will 
      take a very long time for QuotationFinder to receive and process your 
      file. It may well appear to you that QuotationFinder has stopped working 
      even if it has not.
      <br>Another problem comes from the fact that TLG Workplace refuses to 
      export more than about 30 MB of search results with text. After reaching 
      the limit, TLG Workplace will only save the names of the authors and the 
      numbers of hits. QuotationFinder will display a warning if it encounters 
      this, as it cannot search the text of these authors.
      <br>The best thing for you to do is to start with the smallest file you 
      have exported. This way you will find out if everything works as expected
      before you move on to the larger files. If even the smallest file seems 
      to stall QuotationFinder, do a CD-ROM search for the rarest word of your 
      search text, and don't truncate it. If the resulting file is still too 
      big, limit the CD-ROM search to a part of its text base. This is also a 
      good way to get around the TLG Workplace limit described above&#151;you 
      can always save the results for the other part to a different file. 
      &#040;By the way, saving TLG Workplace results as RTF files takes a very 
      long time. Please be patient.&#041;</p>

      <p>Not if you are still working with the same Search Text (see 
      the top of QuotationFinder's main window) and you have not chosen 
      to delete the old results (see above.) By default, QuotationFinder 
      will simply add any new quotations it may find, leaving the old ones 
      untouched until 100 quotations and allusions have been found. After 
      that, the weakest allusion gets discarded when a better one is 
      found, keeping the total at 100.</p>

      now the name may not be exactly what you expected.</p>
